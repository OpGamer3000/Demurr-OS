A subsystem (ig) which is made with Java
go to the master branch to view the src code and the bin files

## What is this?
this is a subsystem made with java its not complete yet so there will be bugz. It will be great if u reported the bugz!

### NOTE!
you have to add a file named disk in the local directory [./disk/] else the system wont have a way to store file lol
and the bin files are for java version 16 and up if you have java 8 then compile the src files ur self
